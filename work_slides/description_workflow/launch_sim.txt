### EXECUTION ###








##############          PHILOSOPHY          #############

The simulation depends on metadata contained in simcfgorig (a json file). 
This file contains many important informations, the one that we are going to change: 
-- sources ->
- creation_rate ->
ROLE:
tells how many people in the simulation for each source each 15 mins.
HOW ARE THEY HANDLED:
They will handled by configuration_handler -> (assign_sources(simcfgorig),assign_new_sources(data_barriers,file_excel,
reset_sources(simcfgorig))  
-- attractions -> 
- timecap 
ROLE:
Tell if places are opened.
HOW ARE THEY HANDLED:
configuration handler -> assign_attractions(simcfgorig), assign_new_attractions()
- weight ->
ROLE:
tell what are the point that attract people' trajectories.
HOW ARE THEY HANDLED:
configuration handler ->
The program is divided into three different files:
--- simulator.py: ->

Contains the definition of the class simulator that contains all those informations that will be used to:
- set the direction of operation to change the 
simcfgorig

--- sim_objects.py: -> contains the definition of:
-- configuration_handler: ->
ROLE:
Receives information about simcfgorig, list of sources and attractions to change, to reset and to add.




Essential elements for successfull simulations:
#CONFIGURATION FILES to be put by hand and little description:
--$WORKSPACE/slides/pvt/conf/conf.json.local.albi.make -> model generation


--$WORKSPACE/slides/work_slides/data

- barriers_config.csv -> set of barriers and their coordinates
EXAMPLE
Id;lat;lng
Pappadopoli;;

-COVE flussi xlsx
EXAMPLE
datetime; ID; in; out
05/07/2020 00:00:00;Papadopoli1_IN;10;15


--$WORKSPACE/slides/work_slides/conf_files
-conf_venezia.json -> all information about sources attr ecc.

Presence of the following hierarchy of folders to be added (not already cloned):
--$WORKSPACE/slides/work_slides/data
--$WORKSPACE/slides/work_slides/conf_files

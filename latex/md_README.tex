This repo contains the codebase for SLIDES project.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{Contents}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Now-\/casting models}}\+: a model for pedestrian mobility and mobility demand in each destination.
\item {\bfseries{Forecasting models}}\+: visitorsâ€™ flows based on mobility demand computed from the experimental observations.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The models are provided as docker containers which expose a series of web APIs whose Open\+API-\/compliant technical documentation is available at {\ttfamily \href{http://container_ip:container_port/docs}{\texttt{ http\+://container\+\_\+ip\+:container\+\_\+port/docs}}} and {\ttfamily \href{http://container_ip:container_port/redoc}{\texttt{ http\+://container\+\_\+ip\+:container\+\_\+port/redoc}}}.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Set up docker container}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
We choose as build context for docker image the {\ttfamily docker} folder of this repo. A proper docker environment is created a the end of \href{build.sh}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily build.\+sh}}}.

A template for docker-\/compose YAML is provided, make a copy that fit your needs and rename it {\ttfamily docker-\/compose.\+yml}.

From within {\ttfamily docker} folder, build the image with 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{> docker-\/compose build}

\end{DoxyCode}
 and start daemon container with 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{> docker-\/compose up -\/d slides\_ws}

\end{DoxyCode}
